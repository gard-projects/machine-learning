# About the datasets
The datasets we will be working with in this project is "diabetes.csv" and "emails.csv". We will be using the Gaussian Naive Bayes for classifying pasients with diabetes, and those without. The latter (Multinomial Naive Bayes) will be used to classify whether a email should be considered spam or "ham" (not being spam). 

## Dataset 1: "Diabetes.csv"
